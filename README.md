# Ugly Query

This project will be JUST like [Ugly Webby](https://github.com/ci-wdi-900/ugly-webby), but this time you'll be editing the JavaScript file ONLY. (Except if, for convenience, you want to add IDs or classes to elements in `index.html`.) Run queries with `querySelector` and `createElement`s until you have the ugliest page possible!

can div2.querySelector

const thatDiv = document.querySelector('#that-div')
